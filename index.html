        <h2 class="h2-1">How to pick your skis.</h2>
        <p class="choosing">Choose the type of ski based on your preferred terrain: Your choices are all-mountain skis, all-mountain wide skis,
             powder skis and backcountry skis. The type of skis you choose will be based on the type of skiing you plan to do.

        <h3>Beaver Creek Resort</h3>
        <p class="beaver-creek">In addition to its standout overall guest service, what sets Beaver Creek apart for beginners and
             novice skiers is its three dedicated learning areas: Haymeadow Park, Red Buffalo Park, and the new-last-season
              McCoy Park. Each of these pods has its own lift—Haymeadow actually has a gondola—that serves gentle slopes
               insulated from the rest of the mountain, so beginners are less likely to get buzzed by speed demons. Haymeadow
                is at the base, but Red Buffalo and McCoy get novices up onto the mountain where they can enjoy the views and 
                pristine mountain vibes that bring us back season after season.

        <h3>Buttermilk Mountain</h3>
        <p class="buttermilk">Buttermilk is the mellowest of Aspen Snowmass's four mountains, pretty much entirely designed for
             beginners to have a place to themselves. The entire trail map is a web of green runs with a few blues and black
             s wound in, so learners can get their ski legs under them on Panda Hill, at the base, then feel comfortable
              leveling up to the Summit Express or testing their new skills on the beginner trails off the West Buttermilk
               Express. Buttermilk also just unveiled its new base area this season, with much easier-to-navigate rentals and
                skier services center.
